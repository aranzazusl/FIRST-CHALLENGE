      <div class="flexbox-item flex-item-1"><h3><b>Translation</b></h3><p>The English word "translation" derives from the Latin word translatio,[6] which comes from trans, "across" + ferre, "to carry" or "to bring" (-latio in turn coming from latus, the past participle of ferre). Thus translatio is "a carrying across" or "a bringing across": in this case, of a text from one language to another. Translation is the communication of the meaning of a source language text by means of an equivalent target language text.</p></div>
      <div class="flexbox-item flex-item-2"><h3><b>Transcreation</b></h3><p>Transcreation is a concept used in the field of translation studies to describe the process of adapting a message from one language to another, while maintaining its intent, style, tone, and context. A successfully transcreated message evokes the same emotions and carries the same implications in the target language as it does in the source language. Transcreation also often involves adapting not only words, but video and images to the target audience.</p></div>
      <div class="flexbox-item flex-item-3"><h3><b>Revision</b></h3><p>Revision is a process in writing that may involve rearranging paragraphs, sentences, and words. Writers may revise their writing after a draft is complete or during the composing process. Revising may involve adding, removing, or editing content in a piece. Revision is closely related to editing. </p></div>
      <div class="flexbox-item flex-item-4"><h3><b>Sworn Translation</b></h3><p>A sworn translation is one which fulfills the requirements in the country in question, enabling it to be used in formal procedures, with the translator accepting responsibility for its accuracy. These requirements vary widely from country to country. While some countries allow only state-appointed translators to produce such translations, others will accept those carried out by any competent bilingual individual.</p></div>
